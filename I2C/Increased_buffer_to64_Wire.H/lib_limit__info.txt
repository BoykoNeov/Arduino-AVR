There are five buffers used by the TWI and Wire library. They are defined as 32 bytes.

In wire.h:

#define BUFFER_LENGTH 32
In Wire.cpp:

uint8_t TwoWire::rxBuffer[BUFFER_LENGTH];
...
uint8_t TwoWire::txBuffer[BUFFER_LENGTH];
In twi.h:

  #define TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH 32
In twi.c:

static uint8_t twi_masterBuffer[TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH];
...
static uint8_t twi_txBuffer[TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH];
...
static uint8_t twi_rxBuffer[TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH];
So immediately you are using 5 x 32 bytes (160 bytes).

You could increase that to (say) 64 bytes, bearing in mind your 160 byte overhead is now 320 bytes, and you don't have a lot of RAM.

The comments about endTransmission() are correct. After a Wire.beginTransmission() nothing is actually transmitted until the endTransmission() call. This lets you fill up the buffer at your leisure, and then let the library do the writes in a fairly timing-specific way.
